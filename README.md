I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uregina.ca/) at the [University of Regina](https://www.uregina.ca/), Canada. My research falls under the broad category of Human-Computer Interaction; primarily, I focus on users’ rapid development of expertise with computer interfaces. I investigate and exploit people’s physical and cognitive abilities to design better interaction facilities and graphical interfaces that support users become experts quickly.

Before moving to Regina, I worked as a Post-Doc Researcher at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada. I completed my Master’s and PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Carl Gutwin](https://hci.usask.ca/index.php/member/carl-gutwin/) in the [Interaction Lab](https://www.hci.usask.ca/) at the [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.usask.ca/), Canada. Inspired by the real-life benefits of landmarks in remembering the locations of real objects in an environment, I have been investigating the use of ‘landmarks’ in computer interfaces as a way to provide efficient learning and remembering strategies for the locations of graphical elements (e.g., commands). I also work in various computing platforms, including traditional desktops, large multi-touch displays, and small handheld touch devices.

Before moving to Canada, I served as a Lecturer of Computer Science and Engineering at the [Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology](http://aust.edu/), Bangladesh, and completed Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Technology from the [Islamic University of Technology](https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/), Bangladesh.
